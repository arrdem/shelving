(defn walk-with-spec
  "An extensible postwalk over data via specs. Visits every spec-defined
  substructure of the given spec, applying both `before` and `after`
  precisely once for each node.

  `before` is applied as `(before spec obj)` before any recursion. It
  must produce a value conforming to the given spec. The resulting
  value is recursively walked according to its spec parse.

  `after` is applied as `(after spec obj*)` after recursion, where
  `obj*` is the result of the recursive walk. `obj*` need not conform
  to the spec which described the traversal that produced it.

  For instance one could traverse using a database insert operation
  which returned an ID, producing a tree of IDs rather than a legal
  record or some sort.

  `#'walk-with-spec` requires that all subspecs be named, rather than
  being anonymous specs. This is required for being able to provide a
  spec name at every node.

  Note: predicates are considered to be terminals. No effort is
  currently made to recur through maps, or to traverse
  sequences. Record structures are the goal.

  If an `Exception` is thrown while traversing, no teardown is
  provided. `before` functions SHOULD NOT rely on `after` being called
  to maintain global state."
